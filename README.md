# osu-skins
This is a compilation of my skins I use in osu!
Majority of the skins are 16:9, and be expected some elements to be misaligned.
The skins are only osu!standard, sorry Taiko, CTB and Mania Player.
The skins are ordered from oldest skin to most recent.
I will also link the original file of each skins, so please don't sue me.
